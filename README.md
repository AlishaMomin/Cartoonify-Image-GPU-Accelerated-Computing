## Objective: 
The objective of this project is to make an application with a basic UI permitting users to apply animation to pictures so that they may produce a cartoony image. The project is intended to give masterful and cleverly engaging outcomes on as wide a scope of pictures as could really be expected, in spite of the fact that not all data sources will yield similarly fulfilling results. The filters are intended to produce artistic output on a wide variety of images. The system is designed with simplicity as the code is developed in C++ programming language, which is simple to grasp yet has a wide range of applications in every industry.
